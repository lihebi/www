			<h1>Distributed Random Servers with Timed Labels for Synchronization over Named Data Network</h1>
			<p>October 2013 - December 2013</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Abstract</li>
				<p class="indent">Key problem of multi-user real-time communication applications, such as group chat and video conference, is how to synchronize messages among all participants. In this paper, we propose a new protocol based on Named Data Network to address this problem. In this protocol, the system will randomly select multi-level servers in charge of the synchronization of time-labeled control messages, while data fetching in distributed way. This method synthesizes the powerful control ability of servers and NDN's distributed features. We implemented our design and it proved high quality performance of fast data fetching and strong control ability.</p>

			<h1>Named Data Network(NDN)</h1>
			<p>September 2013 - present</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Abstract</li>
				<p class="indent">The Named Data Networking (NDN) project aims to develop a new Internet architecture that can capitalize on strengths — and address weaknesses — of the Internet’s current host-based, point-to-point communication architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of communication.</p>
				<p class="indent">Our team focuses on Mobility Support, Application Design, Flow-based Video Transfering(including SVC), Immersive Experience.</p>
				<li>My Contributions</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Built up the topology and testbed of NDN.</li>
					<li>Designed a novel synchronization model for NDN(the paper above).</li>
					<li>Co-designed a novel idea for providing mobility support for NDN.</li>
					<li>Co-designed a novel Flow-based Continuous Data Replying Mechanism in ICN</li>

			<h1>Movie Data Crawling and Data Mining</h1>
			<p>May 2013 - July 2013</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Abstract</li>
				<p class="indent">In this project, I crawled raw data of more than 300,000 movies in <a href="http://movie.douban.com" target="_blank">movie.douban.com</a>. Then I extract useful information into database and analysis them to find out what kind of movie should be popular.</p>
				<li>My Work</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Crawled over 300,000 movies' meta data from movie.douban.com.</li>
					<li>Extract useful information from crawled web pages into database.</li>
					<li>Analyzed the data using content-based recommendation algorithm using directors, stars, labels, points, etc.</li>
